Loupe enhances Vim's |search-commands| in four ways:

1. Makes the currently selected match easier to see ~

When searching using |/|, |?|, |star|, |#|, |n|, |N| or similar, it can be hard to see
the "current" match from among all the matches that 'hlsearch' highlights.
Loupe makes the currently selected match easier to see by:

- Applying a different |:highlight| group (by default, |hl-IncSearch|) to the
  match under the cursor.
- Keeping the matching line centered within the window when jumping between
  matches with |n| and |N|.

2. Applies sane pattern syntax by default ~

Loupe makes "very magic" (|/\v|) syntax apply by default when searching. This
is true even if you initiate a search via a novel means, such as from a visual
selection or with a complicated |:range| prefix.

This means that you can use a pattern syntax closer to the familiar regular
expression syntax from languages such as Perl, Ruby, JavaScript (indeed, most
other modern languages that support regular expressions).

3. Provides a shortcut to remove search highlighting ~

Loupe maps <leader>n to quickly remove all 'hlsearch' highlighting (although
you can provide an alternative mapping of your choosing or suppress the
feature entirely).

4. Sensible defaults for search-related features ~

Loupe provides reasonable defaults for most search-related Vim settings to
provide a good "out of the box" experience. For more details, or to see how to
override Loupe's settings, see |loupe-overrides|.
